        <h3>Hello mate!</h3>
        <p>My name is Urtzi Sanchez Arrillaga and I am from Vitoria, a city in the north of Spain, together with Bilbao and San Sebastian made the Basque Country. After having spent a year living in Switzerland and later making a trip to the USA, and Sri Lanka, in April of last year 2022 I decide to return home to spend time with my family and friends since I feel that I have been away for a long time and I miss my land.</p>

      <div class="family_title col-lg-12">
        <h2 id="familyID">Family</h2>
        <p class="familyPresentation">I am lucky to have a very large and very united family. My father (Armando Sanchez Royo), He has many companies and is always traveling, maybe that's where my desire to see the world comes from. My mother (Maria del Carmen Arrillaga Gabi√±a), I couldn't be luckier to have her, she always supports me in everything, she is my mother and best friend. They met very young and decided to get married and have 4 children. As a good family from the north, our meetings are around a table of food where we not only share my mom mistress' recipes, but also the table is filled with great memories and anecdotes that have marked our lives. My older sister is Erika and she is the only one who, at the moment, has children. Mikel is 10 years old and the oldest of the brothers, then Einar was born, he is 4 years old, with whom I had a very strong connection from the beginning. My bond with him transcends any feeling I have ever had before...maybe he is the closest thing to parenthood that exists right now for me and I love experiencing it. He reminds me a lot of me when I was a child and that makes us both understand each other and share many moments full of affection and mutual admiration. Einar asked me where I had been and why I always left? My heart broke, I promised him that I would soon change my job and spend more time with them.
        Erika is a lawyer, one of the best in Madrid, and a very enterprising woman. Currently, together with my father, they have created a company of which I will be part, carrying out the work of web development and interaction with the customer.        
        Nerea is next, she is the reason I started flying, for being with her (co-workers in Wamos Air). Olatz is the smallest and the prettiest, we have a lot of friends in common, so we go out together a lot, she works as a social worker for the Basque government.
        My grandmother, is 88 years old and the one who make my heart beat. I love spend time with her and talk about when she was younger, also I try my best to explain how stop adding stories on Instagram (because she post on it private conversation of whatsapp all the time)

        <h3><em>What am I doing right now?</em></h3>
          <p class="ptestimonial">Right now, I am working at Wamos Air as a Cabin crew, it is the second time I have worked for this company, the first time was before the global pandemic. It is a job that I really like, I enjoy traveling and doing tasks on board, but it is a lonely life and you lose important moments in your life with your loved ones, I missed my sister's wedding, my nephews' birthdays, Christmas, etc... You know many destinations, but it has a very high price, not enjoying yours, Spain in my case, and barely seeing my family and friends. I have learned a lot in this sector for so long, but it has made me realize that I am missing out on the simple and beautiful things in life, which is enjoying time with my family, watching my nephews grow and one day being able to have and raise a mine.</p>       
      </div>
      <div class="carousel-item a">
        <h3 class="testimonial-text"><em>What have I done since I finished studying until now?</em></h3>
        <p class="ptestimonial">From 2014 to 2015 I was living in Mumbai (India) working as a fashion model, I returned to Spain and I have taken my first Programming course, it was where I discovered that it was my passion. Being a sector that requires a good level of English and at that time I did not know, I went to Edinburgh at the end of 2015, I worked for a year at the Edinburgh airport as a Passenger service agent. I returned to Spain in 2016. I started working in Air Europa offices thanks to having been in Scotland, I worked in the DCS desk Handling department. I was there until 2018 when I went to work at Wamos Air. In 2020 the global pandemic arrived and I was kicked out due to Covid. I went to Switzerland to work during the pandemic and see if I could learn German, since we were in a pandemic the academies were closed. I worked at the Toro Bar in Zurich (Spanish restaurant), where I lived, they gave me a 5-year work permit, but I was only there for one, I found out that aviation was reactivating again and to be honest, all countries are beautiful but nothing compare to Spain, I suppose we all think same.
        Upon my return I started working in Wamos again but due to the champagne effect that has been created in the world, people do not stop traveling, therefore neither do I, I am hardly at home, and I do not see my family and friends. That made me make a decision. Be close to my family as much as I can and Work on what I have always wanted, which is Web/App developer.
        I contacted my friend, Maximilian (he is my friend since 2015). I told him that I wanted to study Full Stack abroad; The USA, Canada or Australia is the best in programming and the ones that have a recognition of studies for international students. He told me that he wanted to grow one of his companies internationally and I could fit there and work together, he would hire me if I obtain the degree.

      <div class="carousel-item a">
        <h3 class="testimonial-text"><em>How is the market in Spain?</em></h3>
        <p class="ptestimonial">Programming in Spain is booming, Malaga the future Silicon Valley of Europe. 90% of Europe is looking for programmers in Spain to work remotely, I suppose it is cheaper to hire a programmer in Spain than in their countries of origin. The salaries of a Junior are around ‚Ç¨25,000 to ‚Ç¨35,000 and a senior more than ‚Ç¨50,000 per year, with those salaries in Spain you are the King.

      <div class="carousel-item a">
        <h3 class="testimonial-text"><em>What will study in Australia bring me?</em></h3>
        <p class="ptestimonial">Studying in Australia will give me the knowledge and recognition to be able to grow in Maximilian company (Impacom). The language used in this sector is in English, so I would organically learn to use those codes. In addition, it should be noted that English is the language spoken worldwide, not only English people, also to anyone from another country. On the other hand, I will also have access to online courses or conferences, or to be able to go to another country to attend these courses, which are usually taught in English, which will allow me to improve much better in my sector.  In short, improving this language and learning and improving programming knowledges will open many doors for me, both at work and at the personal level, allowing many of the limitations I have, will not exist. For this reason, I decided to study Full stack (Front-end and back-end web development) in Australia.

      <div class="carousel-item a">
        <h3 class="testimonial-text"><em>Why study in Australia and not Spain? </em></h3>
        <p class="ptestimonial">As far as academic certificates are concerned‚Ä¶ It matters 10,000 times more. Even though it is the same, why? You study it in English, so the company makes sure that you are competent in the global market. They understand that having someone who has trained with the best can only raise the level of the company and the co-workers. Conclusion, if you want to be different from 95% of the population, you must do different things. The effort of studying for a few years in Australia will be my reward and endorsement to form a life and a dignified retirement in my country, Spain.

      <div class="carousel-item a">
        <h3 class="testimonial-text"><em>Future projects and objectives upon my return to Spain thanks to the course in Australia? </em></h3>
        <p class="ptestimonial">Obviously, in the case of my family, I would work to improve through full stack, the projects/companies of my father and Erika, (ARMERIK ‚Äì ASOCIADOS, S.L, this is already motivating because it is helping my family). Also, as I mentioned before, my friend has offered me, even issuing me a commitment to hire for a job. It is clear that these are doors that are open, but the certificate will open many doors for me due to the market study that I have carried out.
        I have in mind and is not guaranteed is to get into aviation as a programmer, I have 8 years of experience in the sector and it has many gaps in modernization, I want to make Apps internal and improve the lives of workers (since I have been one and I have suffered the delays of non-modernization).

      <div class="carousel-item a">
        <h3 class="testimonial-text"><em>Why Australia? </em></h3>
        <p class="ptestimonial">I have decided to study full stack abroad, as I think it is the best way to grow up in your career. I selected Australia because it has an education system that has been proven to work for many students. Also combines different ecosystems, it has beautiful beaches, cosmopolitan cities, deserts, and jungle. The most important reason for picking Australia is the safety it offers to all the community and the wellness of the students. Last but not least, I have chosen Australia because it is an English speaking country and I will be able to improve and practice the language all day. This gives me the conÔ¨Ådence that I will return home with a great English level, which will be the key in order to achieve my professional goal. I specifically chose Sydney because it is a big city where there are several things in common with the place I am living, Madrid, like the weather, cultural activities and tourists. Upon my arrival I will check the visitor center to check the cultural events and plan the ones I want to attend.

        <h3 class="testimonial-text"><em>Why LaneWay? </em></h3>
        <p class="ptestimonial">While I was looking for the best Full stack course alternative that suits what I was looking for, I found Laneway, which is one of the best institutes. It has the course with the right length for me, it has a nice schedule that would allow me to attend different cultural events around the city and other attractions. Furthermore, Laneway has an amazing facility, which makes it evident they invest in their students. I will take the Web developer full stack course to improve my skills and learn how to do Apps, as it is very important for my professional development when I get back home. Furthermore, being successful at it will help me grow personally. Last but not least, Laneway cultural diversity will let me interact with people from around the world, while having a unique learning experience.
